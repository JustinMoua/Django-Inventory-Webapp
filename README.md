# Demo Project Description

This is a Django application that utilizes bootstrap and jquery. This short project consists of three pages which are a log-in page, a home-page, and an conditions page. The home-page fetches and displays data in a tabular format via MySQL from a table called Inspections. It's unique ids are used as a foreign key in another table called conditions. When a row is clicked on in the home-page, the user is redirected to the conditions page. This page displays the row corresponding to the inspection table that the user previously selected along with the rows whose foreign key matches the unique id of the inspection row that was selected.
